# Thymeleaf + Spring-Boot

### Tiny test application for static data:

I developed this little application as a way of testing how to display data statically from either a List or ArrayList. This first seemed easy, but proved
difficult compared to accessing data from a database, which with Spring is straight forward. By using the DAO design pattern I managed to generate some random
String data, add it to an ArrayList and then display all values in that ArrayList.

1. `git clone`
2. Import pom.xml
3. `mvn install`
